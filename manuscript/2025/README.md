# Instructions for writing the indicator main text and appendix

I have prepared you templates for the main and for appendix. 
Please use these templates when writing your indicator main text and appendix. 
You have maximum 150-200 words for your indicator and you need to use Vancouver referencing style with Mendeley or EndNote.

Please, read the guidance document of main text and the Lancet Public Health Formatting Guidelines before you start writing your result section in the template!

The deadline of the main text section and indicator results is 11th of April, the data, appendix and code deadline is 25th of April.

If you are ready, please upload your indicator main text and appendix to corresponding folders in the Dropbox to the dedicated to WG1 folder and email me and Joacim.

Lastly, please, remember the change in baselines that we agreed upon the last meeting! In the appendix  section you should also provide a note how the change in baseline affects the results compared to the results published previously in the 2024 and 2022 reports.
